# Human-Resource-Management-System



1.  The goal was to develop Human Resource System for freshers or experienced candidates 
which can automatically assign departments to freshers or experienced candidates coming 
into the company.

2. For freshers, there will be an aptitude test focusing on various areas such as front-end, 
Backend, and database. After analysis of scores obtained by the candidate's system will 
suggest the most suitable Department for that candidate and it will show the score of that
candidate in Aptitude to HR.
 
3. It will generate a report for HR describing the total no of candidates appearing for Aptitude 
and their results which will help HR to take decisions.

4. For Experienced candidates, the system 
will analyze their CVs with the expected requirement and will shortlist the candidates as per 
instructions given by HR.

5. The system can have Profiles for Multiple HRs and it will have interactive dashboards.
